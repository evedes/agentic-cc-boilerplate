# Multi-Agent App Development System Architecture

## System Overview

A distributed agent system where specialized AI agents collaborate to build applications through coordinated task execution in separate development environments.

### Core Philosophy
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent specializes in specific domains
- **Autonomous Execution**: Agents work independently within their scope
- **Coordinated Collaboration**: Master agent orchestrates workflow and communication
- **Environment Isolation**: Each agent operates in dedicated zellij panes/tabs

## Agent Hierarchy

### 1. Master Agent (Orchestrator)
**Primary Responsibility**: System coordination, resource management, and user interaction

#### Key Functions
- **Environment Management**
  - Creates/destroys zellij sessions, tabs, and panes
  - Assigns agents to specific panes
  - Monitors pane status and agent health
  - Creates/manages directories at any filesystem level (parent, sibling, or subdirectories)
  - Manages file creation across entire accessible filesystem
  - Handles cleanup of temporary working directories

- **Task Distribution**
  - Analyzes project requirements
  - Decomposes tasks into agent-specific work items
  - Maintains global task queue and priority system

- **Communication Hub**
  - Routes messages between agents
  - Maintains shared context and state
  - Resolves conflicts and dependencies

- **Quality Control**
  - Monitors agent outputs
  - Triggers validation workflows
  - Manages rollback procedures

### 2. Frontend Developer Agent
**Primary Responsibility**: UI/UX implementation and frontend logic and architecture

#### Key Functions
- **Component Development**
  - Creates React/Vue components
  - Implements responsive layouts
  - Manages component state

- **Styling & Design**
  - Writes CSS/SCSS/Tailwind styles
  - Implements design systems
  - Ensures accessibility standards
  - Uses storybook for component development and testing

- **Frontend Logic**
  - Manages and defines the frontend architecture as a whole
  - Implements client-side routing
  - Manages API integrations
  - Handles form validation and user interactions

## Communication Architecture

### Message Protocol
```
Message Structure:
{
  from: AgentID
  to: AgentID | "broadcast"
  type: "task" | "status" | "query" | "response" | "error"
  priority: 1-5
  payload: Object
  timestamp: ISO-8601
  correlationId: UUID
}
```

### Communication Patterns

1. **Command Pattern**
   - Master → Agent: Direct task assignment
   - Includes success/failure callbacks
   - Timeout handling

2. **Query/Response Pattern**
   - Agent → Agent: Information requests
   - Synchronous or asynchronous modes
   - Response caching for efficiency

3. **Event Broadcasting**
   - Agent → All: Status updates
   - Publish/Subscribe model
   - Event filtering by relevance

## Workflow Orchestration

### Project Initialization Flow
1. Master agent receives project requirements
2. Analyzes tech stack and complexity
3. Spawns required agent instances
4. Creates zellij workspace layout
5. Distributes initial context to all agents

### Task Execution Flow
1. **Task Analysis**
   - Master decomposes user requirements
   - Identifies dependencies
   - Estimates complexity

2. **Task Assignment**
   - Routes tasks to appropriate agents
   - Sets deadlines and priorities
   - Monitors progress

3. **Execution & Feedback**
   - Agents work autonomously
   - Regular status updates
   - Request assistance when blocked

4. **Integration**
   - Master coordinates code merging
   - Resolves conflicts
   - Triggers testing workflows

## Inter-Agent Coordination

### Dependency Management
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Declared in task definitions
- **Implicit Dependencies**: Discovered during execution
- **Blocking vs Non-blocking**: Priority-based resolution

### Conflict Resolution
1. **Resource Conflicts**: Zellij pane allocation
2. **Code Conflicts**: Git merge strategies
3. **Decision Conflicts**: Escalation to master or user

### Shared Resources
- **Code Repository**: Git-based version control
- **Knowledge Base**: Shared documentation and context
- **Tool Access**: Package managers, build tools, testing frameworks

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Agent Spawning Strategy
1. **On-Demand Spawning**
   - Agents created as needed
   - Resource-efficient
   - Slower initial response

2. **Pre-Spawned Pool**
   - Agents ready in standby
   - Faster task assignment
   - Higher resource usage

### State Management
- **Persistent State**: Project context, agent configurations
- **Transient State**: Current tasks, temporary calculations
- **Shared State**: Code repository, documentation
- **Agent-Local State**: Working memory, current focus

### Error Handling
1. **Agent Failure**
   - Automatic restart attempts
   - Task redistribution
   - Graceful degradation

2. **Communication Failure**
   - Message retry with exponential backoff
   - Alternative communication channels
   - Manual intervention triggers

3. **Task Failure**
   - Rollback procedures
   - Error analysis and learning
   - Human escalation paths

## Zellij Integration Strategy

### Layout Management
```
Session Structure:
├── Master Tab
│   ├── Master Agent Pane
│   ├── Logs Pane
│   └── Metrics Pane
├── Frontend Tab
│   ├── Code Editor Pane
│   ├── Terminal Pane
│   └── Browser Preview Pane
├── Backend Tab (future)
└── Testing Tab (future)
```

### Pane Communication
- **Direct TTY Interaction**: For terminal commands
- **File System Watching**: For code changes
- **Named Pipes**: For high-frequency updates
- **HTTP/WebSocket**: For complex data exchange

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Add specialized agents (Backend, Database, DevOps, etc.)
- Parallel task execution
- Load balancing between similar agents

### Vertical Scaling
- Enhance individual agent capabilities
- Increase task complexity handling
- Improve decision-making algorithms

## Future Agent Types

### Planned Agents
1. **Backend Developer**: API design, database schemas, server logic
2. **Database Architect**: Schema design, query optimization
3. **DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD, deployment, infrastructure
4. **QA Engineer**: Test writing, test execution, bug reporting
5. **Documentation Writer**: API docs, user guides, code comments
6. **Security Analyst**: Vulnerability scanning, security best practices
7. **Performance Optimizer**: Code profiling, optimization strategies

## Success Metrics

### System Performance
- Task completion rate
- Average task duration
- Agent utilization rate
- Error frequency

### Quality Metrics
- Code quality scores
- Test coverage
- Bug discovery rate
- User satisfaction

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Agent Communication Protocol**: Should we use JSON-RPC, gRPC, or custom protocol?

2. **State Persistence**: Local files, database, or distributed cache?

3. **User Interaction Model**: How should users intervene or guide agents?

4. **Learning & Improvement**: Should agents learn from past projects?

5. **Resource Limits**: How to prevent runaway resource consumption?

6. **Security Model**: How to ensure agents don't expose sensitive data?

7. **Testing Strategy**: How to test multi-agent interactions?

8. **Deployment Model**: Single machine vs distributed deployment?
